Questions
---------
o in python are all strings references to same data? is returning
  original data a risk, and how do I copy?
o look into iterator notation (...) rather than [ ]

Done
----
x Tests
  x assert parent types in test
  x create an API test
x children returns [Line]

Todo
----
o do Line return an index to their user?
- can i refactor with other objects?  or more helpers?
- Create a second implementation with a 'simpler' non-view approach
  - ViewImpl
  - ContainerImpl
