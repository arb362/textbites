=======


TODO
----
- Tests
  - assert parent types in test
  - create an API test


- What if we used the non-view approach?
- Consider whether Line and Lines are confusing, or inconsistent?
- Could possibly simplify by not using array in the resource, to help with off by one
  - and/or we could use arrays with a dummy element
- Should I move this into pybible or a common project?
- is it bad that chapter refs returns an array which is 0 indexed?
  - possibly should return Chapters() reference
