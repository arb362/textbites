  "text":"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."

  "text":" Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.\nHe had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.\nIt was then disclosed in the following manner.\nObserving his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:\n I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\n We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes, said her mother resentfully, since we are not to visit."

  "text":"Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\nThey attacked him in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.\nHer report was highly favourable.\nSir William had been delighted with him.\nHe was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.\n Nothing could be more delightful! \nTo be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained."
